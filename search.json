    "title": "Max Strus is one of the best scorers DePaul has seen",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the biggest reasons why that turn is starting to happen is the talent that has come through the campus of Lincoln park. DePaul has started to see more NBA draft picks and prospects, which has made DePaul a more attractive destination for talented players.\nOne of those players made his impact early and often, and now is regarded as one of the best scorers in DePaul history, Max Strus. The now Miami Heat shooting guard was fantastic at DePaul, earning multiple awards team and conference wide as well as being towards the top of scoring leader boards in the Big East. In addition, Strus is doing this is the best conference DePaul has ever played basketball. The Big East produces tournament teams and contenders like no other year in and year our, and that us very apparent when the amount of tournament teams are compared to DePaul’s former conferences.\nThe data I gathered for this particular chart, and the rest of the charts you will see in this blog, are from sports-reference.com, a site that allows you to get in-depth statistics on practically any sport, coach player, or team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel) \n\nConferences <- read_csv(\"Conferences.csv\")\nDPUPlayers <- read_csv(\"DPUPlayers.csv\")\nScoringLeaders <- read_csv(\"ScoringLeaders.csv\")\n\nConnor<-Conferences %>% separate(Season, into=c(\"Season\", \"Conference\"), sep=\" \", extra = \"merge\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=Connor, aes(x=Conference, weight=NCAA))+\nlabs(\n    title = \"DePaul's Conference Respresentation in the NCAA Tournament\",\n    subtitle = \"The amount of tournament teams per conference while DePaul resided in them\",\n    caption = \"Sports Reference | By: Connor Clark\",\n    x = \"Conferences\",\n    y = \"NCAA Tournament Teams\"\n) + \ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n) + coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big East is not only the most supirior conference DePaul has ever played in, but it is one of the premier basketball conferences in college basketball. With teams like Villanova, Creighton, Seton Hall, St. Johns, the list goes on with historical teams and moments.\nWhen it comes to individual performances in the DePaul basketball program, there are some very recognizable names such as George Mikan, NBA Hall of Famer, and Mark Aguire. Now Strus may not live up to the stature that these guys have (who knows maybe one day) but he does stack up pretty well with guys who have played in the conference era of DePaul basketball.\nI took a handful of players from the Blue Demons that played in the last decade, and stats from their best two seasons at DePaul, and stacked them up against each other with how points they scored per game on the amount of shots they took per game (offensive effeicienty essentially).\nStrus thrived in this chart as he played two seasons with DePaul, averaged at least 16.0 points per game in his time there on over 40% shooting. Pretty good right? Let’s see how it stacks up versus guys such as now Bulls G-Leaguer Javon Freeman-Liberty, Philadelphia 76er Paul Reed and others.\n\n\nCode\nStrus <- DPUPlayers %>% filter(Player == \"Strus\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=DPUPlayers, \n    aes(x=FGA, y=PTS, size=PTS), color=\"grey\", alpha=.3)+\n  geom_point(\n    data=Strus, \n    aes(x=FGA, y=PTS, size=PTS), \n    color=\"#054696\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 11.75) +\n  geom_vline(yintercept = 15.00) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=DPUPlayers, \n    aes(x=FGA, y=PTS, label=Player)\n  ) +\n labs(\n    title = \"More Shot Attempts Means More Points, Mostly\",\n    subtitle = \"Although Max Strus is high in shots taken, he is also higher than many in points per game\",\n    caption = \"Sports Reference | By: Connor Clark\",\n    x = \"Field Goals Attempted\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game\"\n) + \ntheme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring unknown parameters: yintercept\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if we are being honest here, DePaul’s talent pool obviously isn’t the best in the Big East, so it seems pretty easy to see why Max Strus would be towards the top of that chart when it comes to scoring efficiency. So, let’s bring players from around the Big East into the picture shall we?\nThe list of the top-25 scorer in the Big East Conference in 2018-19 is a rather impressive list. Markus Howard from Marquette is atop the list, arguably one of the most electrifying college basketball players the conference has ever seen. Who is second on the list? Yep, Max Sturs out of DePaul.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nhead(ScoringLeaders)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  Player   School        GP   MIN    FG `3FG`    FT   PTS  AVGP\n  <chr>    <chr>      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 Howard   Marquette     34  1125   247   114   229   837  24.6\n2 Powell   Seton Hall     6   184    37    18    25   117  19.5\n3 Strus    DePaul        40  1448   250   122   141   763  19.1\n4 Ponds    St. John's     7   179    36    12    30   114  16.3\n5 Baldwin  Butler         5   141    27     4    12    70  14  \n6 S.Hauser Marquette     34  1077   160    82    68   470  13.8\n\n\nCode\nMax <- ScoringLeaders %>% filter(Player == \"Strus\")\n\nhead(Max)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 9\n  Player School    GP   MIN    FG `3FG`    FT   PTS  AVGP\n  <chr>  <chr>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 Strus  DePaul    40  1448   250   122   141   763  19.1\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ScoringLeaders, \n    aes(x=FG, y=PTS)\n    ) +\ngeom_point(\n    data=Max, \n    aes(x=FG, y=PTS), \n    color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=ScoringLeaders, \n    aes(x=FG, y=PTS, label=Player)\n  ) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Players who Dominated the Big East Offensively\",\n    subtitle = \"A look into who is effecient with the basketball, and who is not\",\n    caption = \"Sports Reference | By: Connor Clark\",\n    x = \"Field Goals Attempted\",\n    y = \"Total Points Scored\"\n) + \ntheme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\nWarning: ggrepel: 17 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps).

A kid who grew up in Hickory Hills, Illinois, started his collegiate career at division II school Lewis University, and now a starter on the Miami Heat, one of the best teams in the NBA. His journey is rather inspiring and impressive, and his accomplishments at DePaul university, and in the Big East shouldn’t go unnoticed."

    "title": "Comparing Chicago Bears’ Defenses, Some of the Best Ever",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Fast forward 33 years and it seemed like the Bears had yet another record breaking defense after a couple of off-season moves, all of which were highlighted by the acquisition of Khalil Mack from the Raiders. The season ran its course, and yes the Bears had yet another physical, electric, record breaking defense on the field every Sunday.\nMany fans and media members started wonder how good this 2018 defense really was and how it stacked up to some of the best defensive units ever to play in the National Football League, so here we are comparing 2018 to 1985.\nLet’s knock out a comparison which uses a stat that is important for defenses, but not the end all be all, which is yards given up per game. Now yards can translate into points, but not all the time. Here is how the two units from Chicago stack up.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nX2018_NFL_Defense <- read_csv(\"2018_NFL_Defense.csv\")\nX1985_NFL_Defense <- read_csv(\"1985_NFL_Defense.csv\")\nX1985Bears <- read_csv(\"1985Bears.csv\")\nX2018Bears <- read_csv(\"2018Bears.csv\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=X1985Bears, aes(x=Week, y=TotalYds), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_line(data=X2018Bears, aes(x=Week, y=TotalYds), color=\"orange\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Weeks of the Season\", \n    y=\"Yards Allowed Per Week\", \n    title=\"Yards are Important, the Bears Kept Teams in Check\", \n    subtitle=\"This is how the 1985 Bears defense and 2018 Defense compare with the yards they allowed per week\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Connor Clark\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall the two were pretty consistent, other than the bears giving up 400+ in 2018 in week six of the season, and the zero number in week five which was the 2018’s squad’s bye week. What is really impressive is that the 1985 unit only allowed 400+ yards one time, and yes offenses have changed a lot since then, it is still an impressive feat.\nNow, let’s move onto what is arguably the most exciting stat for a defensive unit, turnovers. These groups forced a lot of them which is one of many components that make up the nickname “Monsters of the Midway.”\nThe turnover margin is one that caught many NFL fans eyes in 2018 and prompted that discussion of all time greatness. The 2018 group made great quarterbacks of that season such as Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, and Jared Goff (at the time) look very pedestrian and sometimes just down right bad. Let’s take a look at what the 2018 group was able to do in the turnover battle, and how they compared to the rest of the league that season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=X2018_NFL_Defense, aes(x=reorder(Team, Takeaways), weight=Takeaways)) +\n  geom_bar(data=X2018_NFL_Defense, aes(x=reorder(Team, Takeaways), weight=Rank), color=\"orange\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Takeaways\", \n    y=\"NFL Teams\", \n    title=\"2018 Bears Threaten 1985 Bears with Turnover Number\", \n    subtitle=\"The Bears' 2018 Defense was overwhelmingly dominant in comparison to others in turnover margin in 2018\", \n    caption= \"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Connor Clark\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nShifting over the the amount of turnovers the 1985 unit forced, well honestly it just isn’t fair when you look at the numbers. In just 16 regular season games, the Bears forced over 40 plus turnovers, and 7 in one game to close out the regular season. I think it is safe to say that 1985 wins this round.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=X1985_NFL_Defense, aes(x=reorder(Team, Takeaways), weight=Takeaways)) +\n  geom_bar(data=X1985_NFL_Defense, aes(x=reorder(Team, Takeaways), weight=Rank), color=\"orange\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"NFL Teams\", \n    y=\"Turnovers Forced\", \n    title=\"The Bears Took the Football Away, A Lot\", \n    subtitle=\"The Monsters of the Midway defense was the best team in 1985, and arguable in history, at forcing turnovers\", \n    caption= \"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Connor Clark\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be quite honest with you, both of these numbers are absolutely staggering and lead the league in their respective seasons. It also interesting to see how the Cleveland Browns for example were dead last in turnovers forced in 1985, but were second behind the Bears in 2018.\nLast, but most certainly not least, in fact the most important, is the points these defenses gave up. Points scored, and points given up translate to results, and in this case its the less points given up equal more wins that the team has. Here is a scatterplot below that includes both the 1985 unit and 2018 unit and how many wins each team got based on the amount of points they surrendered. The orange is the 2018 team, the blue being the 1985 team.\n(FYI: The defenses sometimes gave up the same amount of points, that is why there is only one dot visible for some results.)\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=X2018Bears,  aes(x=OppScore, y=Result,color=\"orange\")) +\n  geom_point(data=X1985Bears, aes(x=OppScore, y=Result), color=\"blue\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Points Allowed\", \n    y=\"Results\", \n    title=\"Points Translate to Wins\", \n    subtitle=\"The 2018 Bears didn't Give up a lot of points, which created a lot of success\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Connor Clark\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the 1985 Bears suffered one loss all year and that was the only game where they gave up 30+ points in a game. The 2018 squad did that twice and lost both of those games, each reaching overtime. In all honesty the 2018 Bears lost four regular season games that they really shouldn’t have, but hey that’s football sometimes.\nOverall, the 1985 Bears defense is statistically better to this day, but the amount of changes that happened in the style of play in the NFL in that 33 year span and the stats the 2018 defensive unit put up, the conversation of comparison between the two was and honestly still is warranted. Even though I wasn’t alive to watch the 1985 Bears, the 2018 group was still a damn fun unit to watch go out and dominate each and every single week en route to a division title."
